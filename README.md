# Note: This uses code from https://github.com/ArmindoFlores/ao3_api

## What is this?
Some scripts to download fanworks from Archive Of Our Own. It utilises ArminoFlores' ao3_api & reuses functionality from their codebase.

## How do I use this?
Both scripts contain a "search" parameter that can be changed by the user to return a variety of results. I have left an example of a search term in each script. More examples can be found in the ao3_api docs & codebase.
### Manually:
After editing the search param and running the program, you will be prompted to download each work with its title, author, & other relevant info incl. tags. These can be skipped or downloaded. 
### Automatically:
Using the autodl.py script, you can download each work without any user input. 
*** Note that this mode should be monitored as the program could crash due to problems out of my control (rate limits etc) ***
